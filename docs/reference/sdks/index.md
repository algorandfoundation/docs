title: Overview
Algorand provides supported SDKs for JavaScript, Python, Java and Go. These SDKs offer both standalone and node connected functionality. The node connected functionallity is  designed to use the REST endpoints, described below, for the primary Algorand node processes. The stand alone functions offer capabilities for offline or limited connected operation. These offline functions include the ability to work with accounts that are not managed by by Algorand key management daemon(`kmd`) and to work with transctions. This includes creation, signing and appending signatures to transactions. Support is also provided for multisignatures and logic signatures.

Examples of using the SDKs are provided throughout the developer website. Additional examples are also provided within the individual repository locations. Additional developer reference documentation is described below.

# Rest Endpoints
Integration with either the Algorand protocol daemon (`algod`) or the Algorand key management daemon (`kmd`) is provided using a set of REST APIs. These APIs are described using the [Open API Specification version 2 (OAS 2)](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md). Each of these processes serves their respective API on a separate port and url which is stored in the algod.net and kmd.net files within the `data` and `data/kmd-version` directories. Each process provides the specification in a swagger json format that is available using the following REST API calls: 

Algorand Protocol Daemon
```
curl http://$(cat ~/node/data/algod.net)/swagger.json
```

Algorand Key Management Daemon
Assuming data directory is ~/node/data
```
curl http://$(cat ~/node/data/kmd-v0.5/kmd.net)/swagger.json
```

!!! info
    The kmd process is only automatically started when using `goal` commands that access the kmd. This process will also timeout after 60 seconds of being idle. If you require SDK access to the `kmd` you will need to manually start the process with `goal` using the command: `goal kmd start -d <data-dir>`.

All `algod` REST methods and models are decribed in the `algod` [reference documentation](./rest-apis/algod.md). 
All `kmd` REST methods and models are decribed in the `kmd` [reference documentation](./rest-apis/kmd.md). 


# Security Token
Most REST calls will also require an API token header to make calls against the REST server. This token is generated by the process and is stored in a file. For the `algod` process, the file (`algod.token`) is located in the `data` directory. For the `kmd` process, the file (`kmd.token`) is stored in the `data/kmd-version` kmd. Security tokens can be regenerated using the `goal node generatetoken` command.

The API Token for the `algod` process is named `X-Algo-API-Token` and the `kmd's` is named `X-KMD-API-Token`.

Each of the SDKs provides a method for setting these headers. Most REST tools provide a method for setting additional headers. To set the header with a `curl` command use the the `-H` parameter. For example to make a call to retrieve a specific block, use the following curl command from a terminal in the data directory.

```
curl http://$(cat algod.net)/v1/block/31538 -H "X-Algo-API-Token: $(cat algod.token)"
```

In the above example, the block information will be displayed if the block exists on the local node. If the node is a non-Archival node, older blocks will not be available.

# JavaScript
## Installation
The JavaScript SDK is available as [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/algosdk) or as [minified JavaScript library](https://github.com/algorand/js-algorand-sdk/blob/master/dist/algosdk.min.js). The SDK is installed for usage with a Node project using npm. 

Node.js
```
$npm install algosdk
```

To install the minified library, download the library and add it to the project's library location. Use the src tag to specify the location of the library.

```javascript tab="JavaScript"
<script src="algosdk.min.js"/> 
```

The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/algorand/js-algorand-sdk) contains additional documentation and examples.


# Python
## Installation
The Python SDK is available with the Python Package Installer (pip). The SDK requires Python3 be installed. To install the SDK, open a terminal and run the following command:

```
$pip3 install py-algorand-sdk
```
Alternatively, choose a [distribution file](https://pypi.org/project/py-algorand-sdk/#files), and run 

```
$ pip3 install [file name].
```

The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/algorand/py-algorand-sdk) contains additional documentation and examples.

See the Python SDK [reference documentation](https://py-algorand-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more information on methods.

# Java
## Installation
The Java SDK is available in Maven’s central repository and can be used in your Maven project by using the following dependency. 

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.algorand</groupId>
    <artifactId>algosdk</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.1</version>
</dependency>
```

The Java SDK requires Java 7+ and Android minSdkVersion 16+.

The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/algorand/java-algorand-sdk) contains additional documentation and examples.

See the Java SDK [reference documentation](https://algorand.github.io/java-algorand-sdk/) for more information on packages and methods.


# Go
## Installation
The Go SDK is provided as a standard go package and can be downloaded and installed using the `go get` command as shown below:

```
go get -u github.com/algorand/go-algorand-sdk/..
```

The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand-sdk) contains additional documentation and examples.
