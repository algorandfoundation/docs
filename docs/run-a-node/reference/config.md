title: Node configuration settings
Nodes can be configured with different options. These options will determine some of the capabilities of the node and whether it functions as a relay node or a non-relay node. This involves setting parameters in the configuration file for either the `algod` or `kmd` process.

The configuration file (`config.json`) for the `algod` process is located in the node's `data` directory.
If it does not exist, it needs to be created.
A full example is provided as `config.json.example`.
However, it is strongly recommended to only specify the parameters with non-default values in a custom `config.json` file, otherwise, when the algod software is updated, you may be using older non-recommended values for some of the parameters.

Concretely, the `config.json` for an archival node should usually just be:
```json
{
    "Archival": true
}
```

The configuration file (`kmd_config.json`) for `kmd` is located in the nodes `data/kmd-version` (rename `kmd_config.json.example') directory.

!!! info
    Archival nodes retain a full copy of the ledger (blockchain). Non-Archival nodes will delete old blocks and only retain what's needed to properly validate blockchain messages (currently the last 1000 blocks). Archival nodes can be used to populate indexer data. See chart below for more details.


See [Node Types](../../run-a-node/setup/types.md) for more information.

!!! info
    All changes require the node to be restarted to take effect.

!!! warning
    Changing some parameter values can have drastic negative impact on performance. In particular, never set `IsIndexerActive` to `true`. This activates the very slow deprecated V1 indexer. If indexer is required, use the [V2 indexer](../../../get-details/indexer).

# algod Configuration Settings
The `algod` process configuration parameters are shown in the table below.

| Property| Description | Default Value |
|------|------|------|
| Version | Version tracks the current version of the defaults so we can migrate old -> new<br>This is specifically important whenever we decide to change the default value<br>for an existing parameter. This field tag must be updated any time we add a new version. | 34 |
| Archival | Archival nodes retain a full copy of the block history. Non-Archival nodes will delete old blocks and only retain what's need to properly validate blockchain messages (the precise number of recent blocks depends on the consensus parameters. Currently the last 1321 blocks are required). This means that non-Archival nodes require significantly less storage than Archival nodes.  If setting this to true for the first time, the existing ledger may need to be deleted to get the historical values stored as the setting only affects current blocks forward. To do this, shutdown the node and delete all .sqlite files within the data/testnet-version directory, except the crash.sqlite file. Restart the node and wait for the node to sync. | false |
| GossipFanout | GossipFanout sets the maximum number of peers the node will connect to with outgoing connections. If the list of peers is less than this setting, fewer connections will be made. The node will not connect to the same peer multiple times (with outgoing connections). | 4 |
| NetAddress | NetAddress is the address and/or port on which a node listens for incoming connections, or blank to ignore incoming connections. Specify an IP and port or just a port. For example, 127.0.0.1:0 will listen on a random port on the localhost. |  |

| HotDataDir | HotDataDir is an optional directory to store data that is frequently accessed by the node.<br>For isolation, the node will create a subdirectory in this location, named by the genesis-id of the network.<br>If not specified, the node will use the runtime supplied datadir to store this data.<br>Individual resources may have their own override specified, which would override this setting for that resource.<br>Setting HotDataDir to a dedicated high performance disk allows for basic disc tuning. |  |
| ColdDataDir | ColdDataDir is an optional directory to store data that is infrequently accessed by the node.<br>For isolation, the node will create a subdirectory in this location, named by the genesis-id of the network.<br>If not specified, the node will use the runtime supplied datadir.<br>Individual resources may have their own override specified, which would override this setting for that resource.<br>Setting ColdDataDir to a less critical or cheaper disk allows for basic disc tuning. |  |
| TrackerDBDir | TrackerDbDir is an optional directory to store the tracker database.<br>For isolation, the node will create a subdirectory in this location, named by the genesis-id of the network.<br>If not specified, the node will use the HotDataDir. |  |
| BlockDBDir | BlockDBDir is an optional directory to store the block database.<br>For isolation, the node will create a subdirectory in this location, named by the genesis-id of the network.<br>If not specified, the node will use the ColdDataDir. |  |
| CatchpointDir | CatchpointDir is an optional directory to store catchpoint files,<br>except for the in-progress temp file, which will use the HotDataDir and is not separately configurable.<br>For isolation, the node will create a subdirectory in this location, named by the genesis-id of the network.<br>If not specified, the node will use the ColdDataDir. |  |
| StateproofDir | StateproofDir is an optional directory to persist state about observed and issued state proof messages.<br>For isolation, the node will create a subdirectory in this location, named by the genesis-id of the network.<br>If not specified, the node will use the HotDataDir. |  |
| CrashDBDir | CrashDBDir is an optional directory to persist agreement's consensus participation state.<br>For isolation, the node will create a subdirectory in this location, named by the genesis-id of the network.<br>If not specified, the node will use the HotDataDir |  |

If the<br>node has more connections than this number, it will send broadcasts<br>to the top connections by priority (outgoing connections first, then<br>by money held by peers based on their participation key). 0 means<br>no outgoing messages (not even transaction broadcasting to outgoing<br>peers). -1 means unbounded (default). | -1 |
| AnnounceParticipationKey | AnnounceParticipationKey specifies that this node should announce its<br>participation key (with the largest stake) to its gossip peers.  This<br>allows peers to prioritize our connection, if necessary, in case of a<br>DoS attack.  Disabling this means that the peers will not have any<br>additional information to allow them to prioritize our connection. | true |
| PriorityPeers | PriorityPeers specifies peer IP addresses that should always get<br>outgoing broadcast messages from this node. |  |
| ReservedFDs | ReservedFDs is used to make sure the algod process does not run out of file descriptors (FDs). Algod ensures<br>that RLIMIT_NOFILE >= IncomingConnectionsLimit + RestConnectionsHardLimit +<br>ReservedFDs. ReservedFDs are meant to leave room for short-lived FDs like<br>DNS queries, SQLite files, etc. This parameter shouldn't be changed.<br>If RLIMIT_NOFILE < IncomingConnectionsLimit + RestConnectionsHardLimit + ReservedFDs<br>then either RestConnectionsHardLimit or IncomingConnectionsLimit decreased. | 256 |
| EndpointAddress | EndpointAddress configures the address the node listens to for REST API calls. Specify an IP and port or just port. For example, 127.0.0.1:0 will listen on a random port on the localhost (preferring 8080). | 127.0.0.1 |

This string uses a URL<br>parsing library and supports optional backup and dedup parameters. 'backup' is used to provide a second DNS entry to use<br>in case the primary is unavailable. dedup is intended to be used to deduplicate SRV records returned from the primary<br>and backup DNS address. If the <name> macro is used in the dedup mask, it must be at the beginning of the expression.<br>This is not typically something a user would configure. For more information see config/dnsbootstrap.go. | &lt;network&gt;.algorand.network?backup=&lt;network&gt;.algorand.net&amp;dedup=&lt;name&gt;.algorand-&lt;network&gt;.(network|net) |

| MinCatchpointFileDownloadBytesPerSecond | MinCatchpointFileDownloadBytesPerSecond defines the minimal download speed that would be considered to be "acceptable" by the catchpoint file fetcher, measured in bytes per seconds. If the<br>provided stream speed drops below this threshold, the connection would be recycled. Note that this field is evaluated per catchpoint "chunk" and not on it's own. If this field is zero,<br>the default of 20480 would be used. | 20480 |

| BlockServiceCustomFallbackEndpoints | BlockServiceCustomFallbackEndpoints is a comma delimited list of endpoints which the block service uses to<br>redirect the http requests to in case it does not have the round. If empty, the block service will return<br>StatusNotFound (404) |  |
| CatchupBlockValidateMode | CatchupBlockValidateMode is a development and testing configuration used by the catchup service.<br>It can be used to omit certain validations to speed up the catchup process, or to apply extra validations which are redundant in normal operation.<br>This field is a bit-field with:<br>bit 0: (default 0) 0: verify the block certificate; 1: skip this validation<br>bit 1: (default 0) 0: verify payset committed hash in block header matches payset hash; 1: skip this validation<br>bit 2: (default 0) 0: don't verify the transaction signatures on the block are valid; 1: verify the transaction signatures on block<br>bit 3: (default 0) 0: don't verify that the hash of the recomputed payset matches the hash of the payset committed in the block header; 1: do perform the above verification<br>Note: not all permutations of the above bitset are currently functional. In particular, the ones that are functional are:<br>0  : default behavior.<br>3  : speed up catchup by skipping necessary validations<br>12 : perform all validation methods (normal and additional). These extra tests helps to verify the integrity of the compiled executable against<br>     previously used executabled, and would not provide any additional security guarantees. | 0 |

| EnableTxnEvalTracer | EnableTxnEvalTracer turns on features in the BlockEvaluator which collect data on transactions, exposing them via algod APIs.<br>It will store txn deltas created during block evaluation, potentially consuming much larger amounts of memory, | false |
| StorageEngine | StorageEngine allows to control which type of storage to use for the ledger.<br>Available options are:<br>- sqlite (default)<br>- pebbledb (experimental, in development) | sqlite |
| TxIncomingFilterMaxSize | TxIncomingFilterMaxSize sets the maximum size for the de-duplication cache used by the incoming tx filter<br>only relevant if TxIncomingFilteringFlags is non-zero | 500000 |
| BlockServiceMemCap | BlockServiceMemCap is the memory capacity in bytes which is allowed for the block service to use for HTTP block requests.<br>When it exceeds this capacity, it redirects the block requests to a different node | 500000000 |
| EnableP2P | EnableP2P turns on the peer to peer network.<br>When both EnableP2P and EnableP2PHybridMode (below) are set, EnableP2PHybridMode takes precedence. | false |
| EnableP2PHybridMode | EnableP2PHybridMode turns on both websockets and P2P networking.<br>Enabling this setting also requires PublicAddress to be set. | false |
| P2PHybridNetAddress | P2PHybridNetAddress sets the listen address used for P2P networking, if hybrid mode is set. |  |
| EnableDHTProviders | EnableDHT will turn on the hash table for use with capabilities advertisement | false |
| P2PPersistPeerID | P2PPersistPeerID will write the private key used for the node's PeerID to the P2PPrivateKeyLocation.<br>This is only used when P2PEnable is true. If P2PPrivateKey is not specified, it uses the default location. | false |
| P2PPrivateKeyLocation | P2PPrivateKeyLocation allows the user to specify a custom path to the private key used for the node's PeerID.<br>The private key provided must be an ed25519 private key.<br>This is only used when P2PEnable is true. If the parameter is not set, it uses the default location. |  |
| DisableAPIAuth | DisableAPIAuth turns off authentication for public (non-admin) API endpoints. | false |
| GoMemLimit | GoMemLimit provides the Go runtime with a soft memory limit. The default behavior is no limit,<br>unless the GOMEMLIMIT environment variable is set. | 0 |




# kmd Configuration Settings
The `kmd` process configuration parameters are shown in the table below.

| Property| Description | Default Value |
|------|------|------|
| address | Configures the address the node listens to for REST API calls. Specify an IP and port or just port. For example, 127.0.0.1:0 will listen on a random port on the localhost | 127.0.0.1:0 |
| allowed_origins | Configures the whitelist for allowed domains which can access the kmd process. Specify an array of urls that will be white listed. ie {“allowed_origins”: [“https://othersite1.com“, “https://othersite2.com”]} | |
| session_lifetime_secs | Number of seconds for session expirations.| 60 |
