# AlgoKit Developer Tool

[AlgoKit](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli) is a developer tool that is designed to help developers quickly get into writing and testing their Algorand applications. The tool provides support for building, testing, and deploying smart contracts. In addition, the tool supports running a local instance of Algorand. AlgoKit is in active development with many new features on the project's roadmap. Check out the [install guide](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli#install) and the [documentation](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli/blob/main/docs/algokit.md). The [AlgoDevs](https://www.youtube.com/@algodevs) YouTube channel provides a [quick start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dow6U8DxOGc) guide and also detailed videos for installing on [Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22RvINnZsRo) and [Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsurtpCGmgE).

# AlgoDevs YouTube Channel

The [AlgoDevs](https://www.youtube.com/@algodevs) YouTube channel is focused on short-form developer content that provides a quick way to get up to speed on all things Algorand. These 5-10 minute videos cover topics, like writing PyTeal smart contracts, the Algorand Virtual Machine(AVM), Asset creation, transactions, and much more. These videos are actively maintained to be up to date with the current release of Algorand. Make sure to check them out and subscribe.
# Algorand Developer Discord

Join the Algorand developer [Discord](https://discord.gg/algorand) to keep up to date, ask questions, get code examples, comment on new features, and discuss Algorand standards. 

# Smart Contract Examples

The algorand-devrel github repository is a great place to find working examples of larger ideas/platforms (e.g. AMM, mass NFT airdrop), to smaller demos of how to use new features made available within the AVM.
